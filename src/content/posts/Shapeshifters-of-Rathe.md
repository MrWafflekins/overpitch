### My cosplay history 
could be boiled down to the occasional casual cosplay worn to a convention or for some silly OC TikTok’s to fill the void of the pandemic lockdown. During that time, cosplay was a wonderful escape for me. I loved to bring my original (mostly dungeons and dragons) characters to life and show them off to the world (the 500 followers on TikTok that were slowly gained over three years). My cosplays were mostly pieces cobbled together from a stash of old Halloween costumes. The rest were pieces bought from Amazon to fill the void by spending money. I saw it as a perfect chance to dive into my SFX makeup fixation that wasn't being fed by my shitty college “stage makeup” class (that I could have taught better than the very unqualified professor). 

All this to say, I loved casual cosplay and had so much fun with it until the world started to open up again. I started having less time as the commute to school continued and my class load increased. 

Then ProTour LA happened.

My partner made plans to go to ProTour LA this year, road-tripping from NorCal to share an Airbnb with 7 other gamers. I, being in SoCal already, took the train from San Diego to LA for the weekend to join them. In the planning stages for this trip, I had toyed with the idea of cosplaying my favorite FaB hero: Dash. Due to the unfortunate reality of being a broke college student, I was on a tight budget. So, Dash’s young art was the way to go. Over a few weeks, I ordered a cheap Amazon corset and bought a pair of jean shorts from Target. Those were the only two things I had to purchase premade for that Cosplay. I splurged on some muslin fabric that was on sale at Joann’s to make a shirt. 

That shirt was a process
. After hours of scrolling through Amazon for a shirt, I said screw it and decided to give a go at making one myself. I scrolled through Etsy and found a pattern for a Howl’s Moving Castle peasant shirt. Some important context: I have only ever successfully sewn one piece of clothing for myself before. It was a simple elastic skirt for the Renaissance Faire. Thankfully, I was living with an experienced high school and college theatrical costumer at the time. Their skills far exceeded mine, and I would not have been able to make the shirt without them. I nearly lost my mind figuring out exactly what I was doing wrong with the pattern (it had a ruffle. I did not want the ruffle.) My housemate, bless them, had to ask me to step away from the pins to let them do it. I happily obliged. I am proud to say, however, that I successfully made the collar of that shirt by myself. A true accomplishment in my mind. They managed to save the shirt after many hours of reworking the pattern so it wouldn’t look odd on me. It was a success! 

The rest of the pieces for the cosplay were found by rummaging in my costume bins: black fingerless gloves (close enough), steampunk goggles, and some plain brown boots I thrifted two years before. I could have done much more with this cosplay if I wasn’t such a serial procrastinator and a full-time theatre major doing two to three shows at a time with a job as well. Had I the energy, I would have put effort into leg and arm pieces. 

My partner made up for my lack of those pieces though, and 3D printed her Teklo Plasma Pistol for me, and painted it the night before driving 8 hours to LA. 

Now, bear in mind, this was supposed to be a casual cosplay for shits and giggles. I had no real intention of anything coming from it than maybe a couple of compliments and a fun time. 

I cosplayed on Friday, playing in a couple of side events as my beloved Kassai at the time. I didn’t get as many “Let me guess, you’re playing Dash?” comments as I thought I was going to. One of my last games of the day was against a lovely girl who asked if I had planned on participating in the cosplay competition. 

Cosplay competition?

COSPLAY COMPETITION

I was giddy. I could hardly contain my excited curiosity. I said I had no idea what she was talking about, so she explained that there was a registration form for it. She even gave me her discord so I could message her for the details later. 

I was suddenly so overwhelmed with the anticipation of seeing the other cosplayers. 

We got back to the Airbnb that night and the house did not know peace from my excitement. I filled out the form as soon as I received it and prepped my cosplay for tomorrow. 

I was a little anxious when I saw the deadline to sign up for the competition was two days prior, but my partner encouraged me to fill it out anyway. 

Then the day came. I was so excited and nervous and exhausted. But I got up early and did my makeup before heading to the convention center. I spent all day in that cosplay, participating in the Commoner Gold Foil event as the very hero I was dressed as too. I didn’t win, but god did I have fun. 

I filled the time before the competition with side events, mostly losing, but who cares! I was going to be in my first cosplay competition!

Closer to the time of the competition my anxiety about being included past the deadline grew overbearing and I went to the judge's table looking for answers. My fears were relieved by a head judge telling me that it was fine and that I should be able to compete with no problem. 

At one point, another judge came up to me and asked if I was competing. Of course, I said yes, and he told me that the competition time had been moved a little later. I was disappointed, but the judge was so sweet and complimented my cosplay. We introduced ourselves and he invited me to the FaB Cosplay discord. THERE WAS A WHOLE DISCORD?!

I was over the fucking moon. 

After one more hour of waiting, much to my chagrin, it was time. And I started to see the other cosplayers emerge in their stunning costumes. 

The girl who had initially told me about the contest was stunning in her Young Levia cosplay. Her gruesome and gorgeous SFX makeup was applied over lights that ran down her arm to make them glow! To top it all off, she had a detailed recreation of Hexagore to go with it. I was blown away. While her costume was beautiful, she was caught up in perhaps the worst case of stage fright I’ve ever seen. I tried my best to help her shake out the nerves and assure her that nothing could go wrong. My efforts only did so much, but at the end of the day, she killed it on that stage. 

…And swore she would never do it again. Regardless, she was fucking fantastic.

The other astounding cosplay that won first prize was someone I knew! A fellow Bay Area player/cosplayer, Zeni, wore a detailed Kano, Dracai of Aesir cosplay complete with 3D printed staff that smoked. Oh. And the literal fire that shot out of their hand. No big deal. Just the coolest effect EVER. They definitely deserved the first-place prize.

Then we had the fabulous Max Ferocity as Evo Mach Breaker ON FREAKIN’ ROLLER SKATES?!?!?! (Specifically in-lines. Mad respect). As a former roller derby girl myself, I was losing my shit. I was also slightly fangirling since I knew we got the STL files for the plasma pistol from her Dash cosplay, and I’d seen her other mech cosplays when I first thought about cosplaying. 

The other cosplays blew me away: Debilitate, Oldhim, Victor, Bone Vizier, and a full set of the common shadow equipment cycle from Dusk Till Dawn. 

I remember getting on that stage and all my nerves melted away as I said fuck it and got into character. I ran onstage at full speed, stopping just before the edge of the stage and pretending to lose my balance before catching myself and saying, “Gotta dash!” As the MC introduced me and my process of making the cosplay I flaunted my pistol and did silly poses. I was truly in my element. While I may not be great at sewing, or making props, I know how to put on one hell of a show. The performance is part of the judging process, and I knew damn well that I wouldn’t be missing out on any points in that criteria. 

Of course, the performance is not the only thing being judged when entering a cosplay competition. You are also interviewed by the judges beforehand. They asked me to explain my process, the different pieces of the costume, and anything I wanted to tell them about the making of my cosplay. It was intimidating. Very intimidating. Banish a card until the end of the turn intimidating. 

For participating I received a Silversheen Needle Promo and a Fabric of Scales card. Both were gorgeous, and I flaunted them around the Airbnb all night. 

I was invited to join a few of the participants afterward for dinner, which I declined due to my silly shyness around new people. 

This experience, though unintentional, opened a new doorway into Flesh and Blood for me. I enjoy the game of course. There is just something about having this kind of creative outlet that hits differently. The community is accepting, and helpful. They never fail to hype each other up despite the competitive nature of the events we participate in. 

My partner, who qualified for US Nationals this year, later informed me that there was another cosplay competition at Nats. 

And I was so fucking ready this time. I was ready to chase that high that I first got. And I started prepping immediately. 

Thus, a new FaB cosplayer was born and my passion for cosplay was reignited. I couldn’t think of a better community to have fallen into and I’m so grateful to the community for accepting me so readily. 

I couldn’t be prouder to be a Shapeshifter of Rathe.
