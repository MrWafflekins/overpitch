### Maybe the Nerds Were Supposed to be Bullied

Patrick Chapin may be one of those nerds, and yet it's his ideas that spurned this article. Years ago, Chapin saw a vision of the future where TCG metas grew inbred and static in a vicious cycle of self-fulfilling prophecy (editors note: google "hyperbole"). Information Cascades, as he called them, emerged from the tendency of many to take performance data as a direct indicator of strength. Chapin contended that players would make their deck construction choices based on the lists which performed well, resulting in a "cascade" wherein each subsequent individual was blindly trusting the list before them. Like lemmings, gamers would simply pick the list that last performed one after another, resulting in an ecosystem devoid of new material and innovation.

We find ourselves now surrounded by data analysis. Gamers pore over spreadsheets for The Truth of the matter, contending that numbers don't lie. Anyone who has experienced a "no actually my deck is 54.36% into yours and you're better off saving us both time by conceding," should already know that data analytics in TCGs can often be a chimpanzee-with-machinegun style arrangement. I argue that, yes data analysis is a useful tool in any competitively-minded gamer, but we must avoid letting numbers mislead us.  

### In With the Garbage, Out With the Garbage 

Anyone handling data will know about GIGO, or garbage in, garbage out. GIGO is why Frank Karsten gets mad at the jokers who register their tier-0 deck as "4c Maze's End Zubera Combo" (a problem FaB avoids entirely by not even having deck names, well done LSS). Simply, if the data going in is no good, the analysis of that data will show nothing of value. This is the principle behind popular Magic aphorism "leagues are noise." I contend that the average TCG grinder spends too little time considering the card choices in their list, embracing the ease of moving with the herd. Resultingly, these ill-conceived decks smash into one another, producing vulgar data for vulgar consumers.

A Fellow Cold Foil Cartel member and Kano extraordinaire recently made day 2 in Portland, a feat he alone accomplished. His performance on Kano far outstripped projections. If he had made his deck decisions on the available data alone, he would have been playing a deck he didnt care for with cards he didn't choose. He and those like him will find themselves performing better than average even in hostile metagames. 

Experienced gamers may be shaking their heads by this point, convinced that only scrubs would
