### Unlike some, I did not day 2 Calling: Portland.
  In fact, I didn't even day 1. Despite my best intentions, by the time the main event fired I had already decided I would not be participating. After arriving in Portland late Thursday night, I spent Friday in the convention hall getting ready for my first ever "big" FaB event. After selling cards and browsing vendors, I would be playing in CC side events for the rest of the day. By the end of the day, however, I found myself dreading to play the format I had registered for. 
  I, like many others, came to Flesh and Blood from Magic. In the last few months, I have learned to appreciate the questions that FaB asks and the puzzles that you must solve to win. As the Modern metagame stagnated and more of my buddies made the leap, I found myself increasingly disinterested in the offerings from Wizards of the Coast. As I joined in the hype for Portland, so too did I join in the preparation. Provided with the most foiled-out, baller Enigma list imaginable (**Count Your Blessings** intentionally absent), I began my grind. Coming from Magic, Enigma was a natural fit. Her "protect the baby" gameplay and incredible value fit right in with my azorius control sensibilities. The more I played with Enigma, the more I enjoyed it. At first I would play too short-sighted and get punished, but as I kept it up I learned when I should wait and when I should commit. So why didn't I end up playing in the Calling?
  Whether it was the sisyphean task of grinding against **CYB** Mistveil heroes or watching my round timer disintegrate while my opponent paused to read each and every one of my cards, I became disillusioned by my mystic illusionist. Dejected, I dragged myself out of the convention hall to face the group I came in with, only to see that they had all grown tired of waiting for my matches to finish. I left the Hyatt Regency that night with no self respect, an empty stomach, and an overall record of 0-2-2. While drowning my sorrows and desperately trying to convince my group that Formula One was Cool Actually, my mind had been made up. I would rather die than do that all again.
