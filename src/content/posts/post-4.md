### Summer’s End

On the idyllic shores of Summer’s End, a popular island vacation spot, a young man sets out to find the fabled Heart of the End, a place where the real and unreal meet (to say his goodbyes to a friend he lost a year prior). Along the way he must face trials from both this world and the next, as he risks losing his job, his connections, his future, and his soul. 
JACK, 23 years old, is a dealer (and total burnout) local to Summer’s End. His parents have long since retired, leasing him a room in his childhood home. Every year, Jack’s circle grows smaller. As his peers leave the island, the question on all their lips is why Jack stays. Jack, however, wonders why on earth they all left. 
SUMMER’S END, a charming costal town on an island too small to support itself. To the interior of the island is an impassable mass of mountains and redwoods. The damp and dingy interior of the forest holds more than anyone in the town knows, and directly contributes to some of the problems in town. Locals are raised on stories of the forest. An urban legend popular among local children details the Heart of the Forest, a sacred and otherworldly place where the fabric between worlds is thinnest. Superstition is far from the norm in Summer’s End, but the oldest residents all seem to know more than they say.
KEVIN, 37 years old, is Jack’s most loyal client. Kevin’s addiction has become his personality. Brandishing a pot-leaf tattoo on his right deltoid, urban legend has it that Kevin was the first to cultivate in the forest itself, a practice that has since taken over the island’s small police budget.
JANE, 27 years old, is the ruthless head of a small band of growers and distributors. There isn’t enough money in Summer’s End to fund any real organized crime, but the unnavigable environment and low police activity in the forested mountains of Summer’s End make for an exceptionally easy grow-operation. Jane is ambitious and motivated. She sees the island as the perfect start for her illicit empire. Jane has been quietly clearing sections of forest deep in the mountains, it is here that she hears from workers of strange happenings in the forest and rumors of the Heart.
