 [Blurb about going to World Tour Memphis, how Calling: Memphis went, maybe BH: Memphis as well if I run it back Sunday]

For Memphis, I decided to play Aurora again. I knew The Hunted would tempt me to switch to another hero, especially Ira after I learned more about the retrieve decklists utilizing Up Sticks and Run and Pick Up the Point. I love aggro and I love ninja, so that deck is absolutely on my radar going into Road to Nationals season. But after playing some Ira I still found that I enjoyed Aurora’s playstyle more. Particularly Channel Lightning Valley, Lightning Press, and Vaporize//Shock are so fun and powerful it felt wrong playing without them (even if Mask of Momentum is a pseudo CLV). 

Playing Aurora into a new meta meant starting from scratch. Placing 15th at Portland was a great success for me, and the best I have done at a larger than 100 person event, but I knew I could do better if I made the correct deckbuilding predictions.

So before getting into the list and how it differs from my Portland deck, what did I expect? 

In Portland, I knew Runeblade would be big. Particularly the mirror. And I was right! Aurora was the highest represented deck, and I played against her more than any other hero (3 times to be exact). My Vaporize//Shock tech was powerful in these games, and in at least two of them was the difference between a win and a loss. In Memphis, I had a feeling Runeblade’s popularity was not going away, especially as Viserai players have begun to fully tune all of the new tech they got from Rosetta. 

But I also knew ninja would be popular. Fai players spent a long time begging for Draconic Ninja support, and I knew Cindra would pull attention there. And retrieve Ira saw a lot of hype online to boot. Zen’s general strength and popularity is also as relevant as ever, considering Battle Hardened: Toronto ended in a Zen mirror! 

Lastly, Assassin was guaranteed to appear. Arakni, Marionette is so cool and Nuu can easily incorporate Mark if she wants. So Runeblade, Ninja, and Assassin are the targets, while still being mindful of Enigma and many grindy decks that can take Aurora by surprise like Victor and Florian.

That is a wide spread of heroes/archetypes to address! Which means overlaps in sideboard tech becomes more important than ever.

So what’s different in the list? Starting with the cuts:

Immediately the biggest change is the blue count. Anything less than 8 blues felt unimaginable prior to Portland, until I decided to make room in the mirror by cutting almost all of my blue cards and seeing how powerful that was. So now, blues for blues’ sake is 6 maximum, and in many matchups 3 of those get cut.

I’ve also cut down on the combo. Flicker Wisp + Arc Lightning is so powerful, and it turns out it is powerful enough without requiring the support of two pieces of equipment (and sideboard!) slots.  

To my sadness, I also cut Blast to Oblivion. I still believe in the card’s strength, but Aurora can be more consistent without relying on it. If it was a 3 block it would be a staple, but that isn’t saying much.

Snag and Remembrance were tech to help vs. Nuu and Count Your Blessings (Remembrance to also try to combat Enigma). While these may still be relevant going forward, there are better options for addressing a wider range of opponents. Not to mention Snag does not work vs. the Agents of Chaos. 

So with those cuts, what are we left with? 

Pudding Tam came out with a hyper efficient decklist that brought him to a top 8 Calling: Kua Lumpur and a victory at Battle Hardened: Hong Kong. This list helped me realize a lot of the ways in which I was approaching Aurora too fairly. It is far less necessary to be mindful of Fatigue when you are able to efficiently get 4 points out of almost every card in your deck! And further, much easier to address aggro mirrors when some of those 4s are defensive. Notably, I did not love all of his inclusions. For starters, Scar for a Scar and Balance of Justice both feel unnecessary for Aurora into the current meta, and don’t solve her consistency problems regarding Lightning starters well enough. I also feel like Poison the Well doesn’t do enough to address CYB, and is just generally less necessary now that playing all 6 (instead of 9) provides an average of 5 life per 2 cost card rather than 6. 

Now for my additions. Generally speaking the “core” is Just Good and largely hasn’t changed in Aurora since Mercy’s Worlds Osaka deck. But we have plenty of room in our inventory to include unique tech! So remember, our targets are Runeblade, Ninja, and Assassin. How do we address these decks?

First, Warmonger’s Diplomacy is a 3 of. It just has to be. The card is good, and it answers two matchups we don’t love: Viserai and Azalea. It’s not perfect but it’s a block 3 and what we have. I should have brought it to Portland.

Before The Hunted came out, Sink Below became the newest addition that I liked a lot. It filled Snag’s role against Nuu, while also addressing Azalea and allowing us to play a midrange plan into other heroes (like Zen) when necessary. With the release of The Hunted, Shelter from the Storm grabbed my attention immediately. Aurora is a low blue deck, and one problem she ran into vs. Runeblades was dealing with the large amount of unanswerable arcane damage we’d take from runechants. Shelter’s flexibility to answer those runechants, address multiple breakpoints, or at the worst/best being a block 4 from arsenal made it a great candidate to run instead. 

For a long time, I felt medium on Static Shock because it isn’t a Lightning card, which causes problems. But the other options for good rate Lightning cards block poorly and/or aren’t usually starters (see: Blast to Oblivion). So Static Shock is back, and is an effective block 3 that synergizes with our effects like Electrostatic Discharge and Lightning Press. Effectively copies 4-6 of Arcanic Shockwave. This or Arcanic Shockwave will be the cut for Skyzyk once that card comes out, but what will be for another article. 

Lastly, That All You Got? is the most recent inclusion to the deck that I have liked a lot. I think this card is interesting because it addresses some of the problems that Ninjas present while also having text in the mirror. Tiger Taming Khakkara, Zephyr Needle, second Kodachi, and Star Fall are all amazing targets for this card. And it just happens to have text into Dash and assassins (even if it’s just a dreact from arsenal vs. them). Given Ira’s sudden popularity online, I figured this would be the best bet to address what should be a popular pick for the event. When the Cold Foil Cartel started testing the card, my teammates weren’t super sold on running 9 dreacts in our aggro deck, but I feel confident that the midrange plan is necessary at times, and TAYG is how we regain value against Zephyr Needles and Kassaya-enabled Khakkara swings. And in the mirror the card allows us to have better control over the pace of the game, while sometimes functioning as a 0 for 5 vs. the occasional Star Fall.
